### Laboratorul 7

-----------------------

## Compulsory (1p)

------------------------

- [x] Create an object oriented model of the problem.
- [ ] Each robot will have a name and they must perform in a concurrent manner, moving randomly around the map and extracting tokens from the shared memory when reaching an unvisited cell.
- [ ] A message will be displayed on the screen every time a robot visits a new cell.
- [ ] Simulate the exploration using a thread for each robot.
- [ ] Pay attention to the synchronization of the threads when extracting tokens and when visiting cells.


## Homework (2p)

----------------------

- [ ] Implement the commands that start/pause the robots (all of them or only a specific one). A robot can be paused for a specific time or indefinitely, requiring a start command.
- [ ] The commands must be given using the keyboard.
- [ ] Design an algorithm such that each robots will try to explore the map in a systematic fashion, ensuring the termination of the exploration process.
- [ ] Implement a timekeeper thread that runs concurrently with the player threads, as a daemon. This thread will display the running time of the exploration and it will stop it exceeds a certain time limit.
- [ ] At the end of the exploration, determine how many tokens each robot has placed in the matrix.
