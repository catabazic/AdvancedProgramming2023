### Laboratorul 9

-----------------------

## Compulsory (1p)

------------------------

- [x] Create a persistence unit (use EclipseLink or Hibernate or other JPA implementation).
- [x] Verify the presence of the persistence.xml file in your project. Make sure that the driver for EclipseLink or Hibernate was added to to your project classpath (or add it yourself).
- [x] Define the entity classes for your model (at least one) and put them in a dedicated package. You may use the IDE support in order to generate entity classes from database tables.
- [x] Create a singleton responsible with the management of an EntityManagerFactory object.
- [x] Define repository clases for your entities (at least one). They must contain the following methods:
- [x] create - receives an entity and saves it into the database;
- [x] findById - returns an entity based on its primary key;
- [x] findByName - returns a list of entities that match a given name pattern. Use a named query in order to implement this method.
- [x] Test your application.
----------------------

- [ ] Create all entity classes and repositories. Implement properly the one-to-many and many-to-many relationships.
- [ ] Create a generic AbstractRepository using generics in order to simplify the creation of the repository classes. You may take a look at the CrudRepository interface from Spring Framework.
- [ ] Insert, using JPA, a large number of fake artists and albums in the database and log the execution time of your JPQL statements.
